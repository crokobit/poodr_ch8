Inheritance V.S Composition
- Inheritance
You can't extend behavior when a new subclass is a mixture of existing types (e.g you can't model a recumbent mountain bike from a mountain bike and a recumbent bike).
- Composition
adding a new kind of part is a simple matter of plugging in a new object that honors the interface.
